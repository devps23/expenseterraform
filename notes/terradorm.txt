1. create an instance through terraform
2.to create an instance through terraform need some permissions from aws service(valid credentials)
3.go to IAM role
4.create a role
5.insert name
6.link this role to ec2 instance
7. IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions
other wise we will get an error like
 here providing permission for to create an instance in was service

 ********************************************************************************************************************

 to run the automation code through gocd server.

 * we can't able to destroy the ec2 instance because once create an instance it will store some other locations.
  we dicn't know which location instance in generated.
  come back to aws service and destroy the ec2 instance manually...
  so create s3 buket.

  Prometheus: Monitoring  and visualization the environment
  convert any service to Prometheus we need node_exporter.
